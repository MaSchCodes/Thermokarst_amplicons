# Thermokarst_amplicons

Hey everyone,

this directory contains the (bash-based) QIIME2 and R-based vegan analysis of paired-end 16S RNA and ITS amplicon sequences from eroding Arctic permafrost.
Raw data can be found in the repository: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA769429. The final publication on the analysis used here can be found on Frontiers of Microbiology: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.787146/full.
